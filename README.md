# Introduction to Webtask

## Webtask
Webtask is a platform for easily creating a serverless HTTP Endpoint / Webhook. Webtask executes node.js code in a secure and safe manner. There's no servers to deploy, no tools you have to install, just code. 

* Every Webtask is an HTTP endpoint
* Simple Node.js programming model
* High fidelity of HTTP, Webtasks can even return HTML
* 1000+ node modules available out of the box, support for any node module with package.json
* Rich browser based editing experience
* Middleware 
* Multi-tenant
* Extremely low latency

## How does it differ from other Serverless offerings.

* Designed from scratch for web-based / user interactions rather than plumbing between backend services.
* Specialized for Node.js
* Low configuration
* Highly customizable
